# gatsby-transformer-webpconv (DEPRECATED)

This was an example transformer to interact with another plugin I develop 
pertaining GIFs and return a fixed / fluid structure like `gatsby-transformer-sharp`.

Both are now available under a new name in a [`lerna`](https://lerna.js.org/)
managed monorepo over at [`gatsby-giffit`](https://github.com/timhagn/gatsby-giffit)!
