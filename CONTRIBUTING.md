# Contributing to `gatsby-plugin-webpconv`

_**First of all, thanks for your time reading this and contributing : )!**_   
Contributors are always welcome here and can't be thanked enough for their work!

The following shall be some rough guidelines to get you going on your quest to 
contribute to `gatsby-plugin-webpconv`.

## Your Gain from Contributing

Right now you're gonna get my eternal thankfulness and reputation in helping
out in a small but hopefully growing OSS package : ).

But, no fear, I'm thinking of ways to give you more reward than that, and am
definitely open for any ideas (methinks [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/)
would be a little over the top at the moment, but just raise your opinion : )!

## Code of Conduct

As this is a rather new package, no real transgressions of human decency
have occurred.  
I'd rather like it to stay that way, so without further ado:   
*just try to be and write as your very best self - nobody's here to bite or be 
bitten, right ; )?*

That being said sums it up quite nicely - thou should you need more specific guidelines,  
this package-project wants to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to start to contribute

Be it fixing typos (which I think there may be many of ; ), enhancements to 
documentation (including this file), code changes or whatever you might have up 
your sleeve: Here are some of the ways you may contribute. 

### Questions / Issues / Bugs / Enhancements

Have an issue or bug you want addressed? Have a feature request or another 
enhancement you'd really want to see in the next version of this package?
Or just have a question pertaining some functionality?

At the moment every one of these cases is tracked as a [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Already know how to handle them? Head over to the [issue section](https://github.com/timhagn/gatsby-plugin-webpconv/issues),
and please try first to search for any open or closed issues which might already 
have addressed your's. 
  
Haven't found one? Open a new issue and follow the template guidelines there!

### Pull Requests

First of all fork [gatsby-plugin-webpconv](https://github.com/timhagn/gatsby-plugin-webpconv)
and clone your fork of it. For textual changes (typos, documentation, addition)
just write them and read below about creating a PR.

 
To change or add some code execute either `yarn` or `npm install` in your cloned 
forks folder first, to get yourself up and running for development.

*But now you are good to go and make some changes!*
(Afterwards, to finalize them before you push em, you may want to run 
`yarn format` or `npm run format`, to use `prettier` to bring your code in line 
with our "coding standards" ; ).


Last but not least, head over to GitHub and create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) 
with your changes : )! 

### Testing

First of all, you're definitely welcome to do manual functional or performance 
tests and report back on it in an issue or suchlike : )!

Though of course this package will never be able to have enough coverage ; )!  
Especially functional tests are missing at the moment.

All tests are run with `jest` / `jest-dom` and `react-testing-library`
at the moment, transformed through `babel-jest`.
  
To get an overview of the tests already existing, run either `yarn test` or 
`npm run test` and head over to the [test folder](d/__tests__) to see where
you may help out with some changes : )!

### Final thoughts

Thanks again for reading this and happy contributing!

Best,

Tim.
